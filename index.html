      <h2 id="part 1">My Start in the game</h2>
      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.7vpEx4xj7wa_807XGElNjAHaEO%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="Young boys playing basketball" width="200px"/>
      <p>I never really thought of basketball as a game that I could play originally. It has usually been the domain of <a class="shaq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal">Giants</a>.  A friend wanted to play though and just like any sport it required more than one to play.  Before I knew it I was playing every Thursday afternoon.  It was like an invisible crack in my armour had been patched up.  I now had something to call my own, but it wasn't my game alone.</p> 
      <h2 id="part 2">Early Success</h2>
      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.9VUnRp1cdsMofFH2upAS3wHaEP%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="WINNING!!!" width="200px"/>
      <p>What I hadn't expected was that I was going to be playing in such a hostile environment.  We walked into a gymnasium filled with absolute beasts.  Each of them concerned with only one thing...victory.  During my first few years I was pushed to the brink on and off the court by a group that ate, slept and breathed the game.  Thanks to that unreasonable work ethic I got to be a part of the best team in the city picking up two titles in my first year of playing.</p>
      <h2 id="part 3">Crashing to reality</h2>
      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.explicit.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.PLM2Avj5VuPyGokCMYt7xQHaD9%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="Falling into some swimming pools" width="200px"/>
      <p>After a while I had gained some abilty.  Along with it also a misplaced sense of confidence.  As me and my buddy improved we started ramping up our time on court.  We joined a team playing in the <a class="shaq" href="http://basketballscotland.co.uk/league/139393/">National league</a> in our city.  A humbling string of weekends ensued.  Being handed defeats almost every weekend without fail.  My limitations became abundantly clear and my place in the true basketball hierarchy of Scotland apparent.</p>
      <h2 id="part 4">The Breakthrough</h2>
      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.mEdbj935N-a7rDM3sssETgHaE7%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="The lightbulb comes on in your head" width="200px"/>
      <p>After this humbling season we knew changes had to be made.  A year older, wiser and probably most importantly taller I once again took to the hardwood.  At this point I had grown not only physically but also mentally as well.  The game had evolved from just <a class="shaq" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbOsxamKyzY">pass</a>, <a class="shaq" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC5r3LK0UY4">shoot</a> and <a class="shaq" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5WGTqEC9kc">dribble</a>.  I was now playing <a class="shaq" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RmdI7plK3Q">a game of zones</a>, being careful about timing as well as execution.  My game had never been so polished.  We improved markedly in the league and as one of the key players I led the school team to the Glasgow cup finals.   </p>
      <h2 id="part 5">Losing the Fire</h2>
      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.eLQiplJfqyF2VqDHphTjcwHaE7%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="The dying embers" width="200px"/>
      <p>While riding this euphoric rollercoaster ride I was suddenly bucked off my seat.  Every athletes worst nightmare...injury.  The GP diagnosed it as <a class="shaq" href="https://www.nuh.nhs.uk/osgood-schlatters-disease">Osgood Schlatters Disease</a>.  The prescribed treatment?  Four months on the sidelines.  During this time I learned a lot more about myself beside just how good I might be able to get at basketball; I started to socialise a bit more often; found that I had good aptitude for learning.  By the time I had finished the rehab period basketball seemed like one of the least important things in my life.</p>
      <h2 id="part 6">Coming Home</h2>
      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.XihxEWEU6EnW2aD7j92wKAHaDt%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="Homecoming" width="200px" height="120px"/>
      <p>I thought the <a class="shaq" href="https://basketballhq.com/setting-screens-in-basketball">screens</a> in basketball were tough but real life buts up some much steeper barriers.  I trundled through my adolescence doing whatever took my fancy.  Slowly the invisible crack began to reappear.  I didn't really notice it but it was there again.  One chance weekend I met a gentleman who during conversation mentioned he also played the game.  After a quick chat I had been invited to a pick up game.  Being back on the hardwood after all that time was an interesting feeling to have.  In part I was ashamed that my fitness and skills had atrophied so much.  On the other hand though it was like I was back in my natural habitat.  I could sense the movement patterns returning.  The feel for the ball in your hands.  The millisecond thought processes.  It was like being pumped full of adrenaline.  Finally I was back home.</p>
