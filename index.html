      <p>I never really thought of basketball as a game that I could play originally. It has usually been the domain of <a class="shaq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal">Giants</a>.  A friend wanted to play though and just like any sport it required more than one to play.  Before I knew it I was playing every Thursday afternoon.  It was like an invisible crack in my armour had been patched up.  I now had something to call my own, but it wasn't my game alone.</p> 
      <h2 id="part 2">Early Success</h2>
      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.9VUnRp1cdsMofFH2upAS3wHaEP%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="WINNING!!!" width="200px"/>
      <p>What I hadn't expected was that I was going to be playing in such a hostile environment.  We walked into a gymnasium filled with absolute beasts.  Each of them concerned with only one thing...victory.  During my first few years I was pushed to the brink on and off the court by a group that ate, slept and breathed the game.  Thanks to that unreasonable work ethic I got to be a part of the best team in the city picking up two titles in my first year of playing.</p>
      <h2 id="part 3">Crashing to reality</h2>
      <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.explicit.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.PLM2Avj5VuPyGokCMYt7xQHaD9%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="Falling into some swimming pools" width="200px"/>
      <p>After a while I had gained some abilty.  Along with it also a misplaced sense of confidence.  As me and my buddy improved we started ramping up our time on court.  We joined a team playing in the <a class="shaq" href="http://basketballscotland.co.uk/league/139393/">National league</a> in our city.  A humbling string of weekends ensued.  Being handed defeats almost every weekend without fail.  My limitations became abundantly clear and my place in the true basketball hierarchy of Scotland apparent.</p>
